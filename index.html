                          Today, the health communication played a significant role during the coronavirus outbreaks. China and South Korea were first respondents to take an action against the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively succeeding with low number of cases compared to other countries. Their success was a result of their history with coronavirus outbreaks that equipped them to take an advantage of technology in the health communication: social media. Social media is a robust tool that had been provided to the public where information is easily accessible at its fingertip. The study was interested to understand how China and South Korea’s health communication could be effective today compared to their communication during the 2003 SARS and the 2015 MERS outbreaks. The review of articles would discuss on the development of media dependency that delineated the relationship between individuals and media against the government. It also provided the insights on the differences between the 2003 SARS, 2015 MERS, and 2019 COVID-19 outbreaks based on the evaluation of health communication.

                  <dd>
                    <p>
                      The relative importance of preorganization, selective transition state stabilization and inherent reactivity are assessed through quantum chemical and docking calculations for a sesquiterpene synthase (epi-isozizaene synthase, EIZS). Inherent reactivity of the bisabolyl cation, both static and dynamic, appears to determine the pathway to product, although preorganization and selective binding of the final transition state structure in the multi-step carbocation cascade that forms epi-isozizaene appear to play important roles.

                  <dd>
                    <p>
                      Although evidence has mounted in recent years for the biosynthetic relevance of [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions, other cycloadditions have received much less attention. Herein we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess the viability of nitrone–alkene (3 + 2) cycloaddition reactions proposed to occur during the biosynthesis of several alkaloid natural products (flueggines and virosaines). The results of our calculations indicate that these reactions have low enough intrinsic barriers and diastereoselectivity that they can proceed without enzymatic intervention.
